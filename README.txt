Description: This project is a mini-quiz platform made with Python 
Django. It contains 55 questions and randomly quizzes the user on 5
such questions in the 4 following formats: Multiple choice, True/False,
Fill in the Blanks, and Matching. Each user's grade history is stored 
in the database. After each quiz, each user is provided with graded 
results and details on correct answers vs. the user's answers.
